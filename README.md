## Overview
The Eat-Da-Burger app allows a user to input the burger of their choice and then devour it if they choose. Once the new burger is put into the field & the Add burger button is pressed, that burger appears in the list on the left side of the screen (Burgers to Devour section). If the user clicks on the Devour It! button then the burger moves to the right side of the screen (Burgers Devoured section). Or they can devour an existing burger that has yet to be devoured and the same movement will happen.

### Technical specifications
This application demonstrates a full stack application using the MVC model (Model–View–Controller). HTML/CSS and Handlebars were used for the front end of the application - Handlebars handled the HTML templating. The burger animation was created solely using CSS. The backend of the application was implemented with Node, Express, & a homemade ORM.
Once a burger is inputted into the form, it is inserted into the mySQL database with a devoured status of False (i.e. 0) which puts it into the list on the left side of the screen. Once the devoured button is submitted then that devoured status is updated to True (i.e. 1) and the burger moves to the right side of the screen. Simple HTML5 form validation is performed by the browser.
